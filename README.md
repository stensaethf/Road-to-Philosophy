# Road-to-Philosophy
Rumor has it that all articles on Wikipedia lead to philosophy. True? Well, no...but apparantly 94.52% of all Wikipedia articles do, which is fascinating.

The rules of the game rather are simple:

1. Click on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link.

2. Ignore external links, links to the current page, or red links.

3. Stopp when you have reached "Philosophy", a page with no links, a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs.

Note:

This implementation requires that any link must also be within a paragraph HTML tag.
