# Road-to-Philosophy
Rumor has it that all articles on Wikipedia lead to philosophy. True?

The rules are simple.

1. Click on the first non-parenthesized, non-italicized link.

2. Ignore external links, links to the current page, or red links.

3. Stopp when you have reached "Philosophy", a page with no links, a page that does not exist, or when a loop occurs.


[In progress]

Remaining to implement:

Parenthesis, red-links
